# Overview

Unlike programming languages - natural languages exists and are in every day use. They do suffer from heavy legacy (~ 2021 years of legacy) and tends to be really difficult 
to parse and analyze. There exists enourmous amount of different approaches and techiques to parse, analyse and extract natural language.

Here are some articles related to that one for example:

[In Russian: Изучаем синтаксические парсеры для русского языка](https://m.habr.com/ru/company/sberbank/blog/418701/)

Language itself can be collected into it's own database of words, lingistic rules related to language itself.

Such attempt can be observes for example in universal dependencies:

[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/)

and content, which is organized by them:

[CoNLL 2018 Shared Task](http://universaldependencies.org/conll18/)

Unlike programming languages - natural languages suffer from lack of proper structuratization and not being able to define a program in clearly defined state.

But also transitioning or teaching (8 billion people)[https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/] new artifically created language is mission impossible.
