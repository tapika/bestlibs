# Overview

On my daily work I'm constatly hitting accross one or another library or technique - all of libraries have their own advantages,
weaknesses and side effects. I've decided to collect here some of libraries.

## Programming Languages

  * [C++](https://github.com/tapika/bestlibs/tree/main/cpp)

## Game Engines

*Libraries dealing with game development*

* Godot Engine (C++)
  * [Godot git](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), [Main web page](https://godotengine.org/) [MIT]
  * Articles:
    * [Is Making Advanced GUI Applications with Godot the Future?](https://medium.com/swlh/what-makes-godot-engine-great-for-advance-gui-applications-b1cfb941df3b)


## Installation

*Libraries dealing with package building and installation*

  1. [Chocolatey, C#](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco) [MIT] - Based on nuget client/server architecture chocolatey deals with software installation, upgrade, uninstallation
  2. [Microsoft MSIX packaging, C++](https://github.com/microsoft/msix-packaging) [MIT] - Package management primarily targetted for Windows.

## 3rd Party Library Building

  * [Microsoft vcpkg, C++ + cmake](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) [MIT] tool for building various 3rd party packages for Windows.
